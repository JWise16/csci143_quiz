The first four lines of every problem will always be the same.
Variations of this problem include:
(1) removing the \lstinline{git init} command,
(2) removing or adding \lstinline{touch} / \lstinline{mkdir} / \lstinline{cd} commands,
(3) changing the referenced filenames,
and (4) adding the \lstinline{-a} flag to the final \lstinline{ls} command.
