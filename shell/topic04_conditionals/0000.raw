\begin{note}
Like for loops, if statements have subtle interactions with the \lstinline{$} operator and various types of quotation marks.
In the shell, expressions are contained within square brackets \lstinline{[ ]}, the operator \lstinline{&&} is \lstinline{and}, \lstinline{||} is \lstinline{or}, and \lstinline{!} is \lstinline{not}.
\end{note}
