\begin{note}
Variables and quotation marks have subtle interactions in the shell,
and these interactions are a common source of bugs.
The dollar sign \lstinline{$} is the \emph{variable expansion operator}.
Variables get expanded before determining the arguments to executables,
and so if a variable has a space then it will result in multiple arguments.
Variable expansion does not happen within single quotes \lstinline{'},
but does happen within double quotes \lstinline{"} and backticks \lstinline{`}.
Double quotation marks cause spaces to be ignored when determining arguments to an executable.
Backticks cause the contents to be executed by a \emph{subshell}.
Backticks are equivalent to the \emph{command expansion operator} \lstinline{$()}.
