\begin{note}
The \lstinline{<<} operator creates a \emph{heredoc}.
This operators allows you to define a document ``right here'' in the shell (i.e. without creating the document on disk) to be passed to the command as input.
The \lstinline{<<} operator is immediately followed by a string,
and the heredoc is terminated when the exact same string appears on a line by itself.
EOF (end of file) is the traditional choice of string,
but other strings are also valid.
