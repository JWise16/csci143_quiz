Shell Topic 00: Input/Output Redirection and Pipes
}
\vspace{0.1in}
\end{center}

\begin{note}
There are three principles of the \emph{Unix Philosophy}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Write programs that do one thing and do it well.
\item Write programs to work together.
\item Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface.
\end{enumerate}
Redirection and pipes are the glue that makes the Unix philosophy work.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
The \emph{output redirection operator} \lstinline{>} takes the output of a program and saves it to a file.
If the file already exists, the contents are overwritten.
The \emph{append operator} \lstinline{>>} is like \lstinline{>} but it appends instead of overwriting.
The \emph{input redirection operator} \lstinline{<} opens a file and passes the contents as the input to a command.
The \emph{pipe} \lstinline{|} takes the output of the previous command and sends it to the input of the subsequent command.
\end{note}
