The POSIX shell has a built-in pattern matching feature for working with files.
The glob operator \lstinline{*} matches zero or more of any character,
and the question operator \lstinline{?} matches exactly one of any character.
The \lstinline{*} and \lstinline{?} operators do not match a dot at the beginning of the file, and so do not match hidden files.
