\begin{note}
Environment variables are a special type of variable whose value gets passed to all children of the shell.
They are commonly used to store sensitive information like passwords or API keys.
They can be created using the \lstinline{export} keyword (which also creates a standard shell variable)
or using \emph{command prefix notation} (which does not create a standard shell variable).
