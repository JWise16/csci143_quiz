Think step by step.  Ensure that your final answer is on a line by itself and separated from the reasoning step by the string `ANSWER:` on a line by itself.  Use the format in the following example.

QUESTION:
```
rm *
ls | wc -l
```
REASONING:
The `rm *` command deletes all the files in the current folder.
Therefore, when the `ls` command lists all of the files, there will be no output.
So piping an empty string to `wc -l` will output 0.

ANSWER:
0
