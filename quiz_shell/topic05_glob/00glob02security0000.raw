\begin{note}
Glob expansion happens in the shell,
before the parameters are sent to the program.
This can have unintended side effects.
If you are working in a directory where someone else is allowed to create files,
they can create files that will be expanded by \lstinline{*} into command line arguments.
This problem can be mitigated by using \lstinline{./*} instead of \lstinline{*}.

\begin{note}
This note describes a non-POSIX GNU extension to the shell.
It is widely supported and very useful,
and is the only non-POSIX syntax in this sequence of quizes.
Command line arguments that appear after a \lstinline{--} will always be interpreted as files.
It is therefore safe to use the glob after \lstinline{--} and files will not be able to change the behavior of a program.
