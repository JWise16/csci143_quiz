\begin{note}
Glob expansion happens in the shell,
before the parameters are sent to the program.
This can have unintended side effects.
If you are working in a directory where someone else is allowed to create files,
they can create files that will be expanded by \lstinline{*} into command line arguments.
This problem can be mitigated by using \lstinline{./*} instead of \lstinline{*}.
Command line arguments that appear after a \lstinline{--} will never be interpreted as command line arguments.
