\begin{note}
Inline conditional statements are possible in most programming languages (including python),
but they are particularly common in the shell.
These statements take advantage of the \emph{short circuiting} behavior of boolean operators.
That is, the and operator \lstinline{&&} only evaluates its second argument if the first argument is true,
and the or operator \lstinline{||} only evaluates its second argument if the first argument is false.
\end{note}
