\begin{note}
All programs have an exit code associated with them that indicate whether the program succeeded (exit code 0) or failed (a non-zero value).
Success is interpreted as true within boolean expressions,
and failure is interpreted as false.
The \lstinline{grep} program succeeds whenever it finds a match for its regular expression in the input.

Many of the shell features we've observed above are special cases of the exit code behavior.
The \lstinline{true} and \lstinline{false} commands are actually programs that always return 0 and 1 respectively.
The \lstinline{[} operator is just a normal executable program that interprets its command line arguments as a boolean expression and returns 0 if the expression is true and 1 otherwise.
